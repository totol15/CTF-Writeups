### **Solution**

From the challenge description, we can deduce that `aeg{at_imuf_nussqd_zgynqd_paqezf_yqmz_yadq_eqogdq}` may be the flag but rotated 727 times. Notice that it is of the form "(3 letters){(other stuff)}", which fits the flag pattern of "osu{(flag)}". So we can put it into Cyberchef and rotate it 14 times, which gives us this:

The flag is: `osu{oh_wait_bigger_number_doesnt_mean_more_secure}`
